# Invalid or undefined route configuration or navigation path

This runtime error occurs when Angular's router is unable to resolve a valid route during naigation, likely due to an invalid or undefined route configuration or navigation path.
It can also occur if there is an issue with lazy-loaded modules.

## Debugging the error

You can use `Router.events` to capture navigation error logs:

```typescript

this.router.events.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event instanceof NavigationError) {
    console.error("Navigation Error:", event.error);
  }
});

```

Some Third-Party Integrations may mask details of Angular errors. You can enable detailed logging in Angular to get verbose logs

```typescript

import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
enableProdMode();

```

## Fixing the error

1. Check that all routes are correctly configured in all routing modules. Ensure no paths resolve to `undefined`.

2. If you are using lazy-loading, check if `loadChildren` property is pointing to an invalid module

3. If you have dynamic navigation, check that `Router.navigate` or `Router.navigateByUrl` is not making a call using empty string, incorrect parameters or undefined parameters.

```typescript

this.router.navigate([undefined]); // this is invalid

```

4. Make sure your wildcard routes have proper fallback routes.

```typescript

{ path: '**', redirectTo: '' } //handle unmatched paths correctly

```
